                                    After years of dedication to business consulting and with a passion for the technology sector,
                                    I decided to embark on a journey into web development. Gradually, this industry has captivated me,
                                    leading to my complete immersion today.

                                    Upon completing my training at Ironhack, I've emerged from weeks of intensive MERN stack training,
                                    ready to make a positive impact in the industry. I continue to develop projects and expand my knowledge of new technologies,
                                    as showcased on the It Tools page.
